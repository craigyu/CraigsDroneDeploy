# CraigsDroneDeploy

<h3>Hello DroneDeply!</h3>

<p>
This was a fun project, it was quite challenging as well, since there aren't much online documentation about PDF.
</p>
<p>
In this project I was able to retreive the tiles, process it, then render it in the right order.
My approach was to render the map to a canvas, then export it using jsPDF and html2canvas.
I couldn't find a way to take a "screenshot" of the canvas, due to the canvas is tainted by cross-origin data.
Setting <code>crossOrigin = "Anonymous"</code> didn't work, I won't be able to access the tile images that way.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn have worked on this more, however due to the upcoming finals I couldn't spend more time.  <br />
Everything here were done within a night. <br />
The project structure is based on the example from DroneDepoly.<br />
Thank you!
</p>
